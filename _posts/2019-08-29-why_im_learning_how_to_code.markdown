I grew up on the internet. From as early as second grade, I was camped out in front of my family's desktop, waiting for YouTube videos to buffer or playing minigames. At this point, I've built a whole virtual life that is inextricable from my "real" life. In fact, I just moved across the country from New York to Montana to live with a friend I met on Tumblr a decade ago. 

Technology has proven to be somewhat of a democraticizing force in my life, giving me access to a wide range of people and ideas. It changed the way that I learned about things and changed the way I think about education. In my undergrad career, I focused on the politics and economics of education because *access* to ideas is something I find incredibly important. I'm learning how to code because I'm motivated by the possibility of building products that will contribute to changing the way people interact with each other and the world they inhabit.
